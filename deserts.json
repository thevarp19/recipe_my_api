    "2. For the cake, preheat the oven at 160 degree Celsius. Line a 9” round baking tin with oil and add flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa powder in it. Stir it well and then set it side. In a large bowl, whip together condensed milk and 1/4 cup of butter. Whisk it until the mixture is creamy and add red food color to it. Whisk it again until it is smooth.",
    "3. Now, add flour mixture to the condensed milk mixture gradually, in small batches, while stirring it constantly. Add yogurt along with 1 teaspoon icing sugar, apple cider vinegar and whisk for another 2 minutes, until it attains a batter-like consistency. Don’t over whisk the batter. Pour the batter in the tin and bake it in a preheated oven for 30 minutes. Bake until the knife or toothpick comes out clean. Once done, let it cool and top up with cream cheese frosting to enjoy!"

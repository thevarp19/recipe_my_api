    "3. Optionally, tear up some basil leaves by hand and mix them into the sauce.",
    "4. Prepare the pizza dough ahead of time, at least 2 hours before you want to start cooking your pizza. In a mixing bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, yeast, sugar and salt.",
    "5. Place two-thirds of the water in a large bowl. Bring the other third of water to boil, then add it to the cold water in the bowl. This creates the correct temperature for activating yeast.",
    "6. Add the water and oil to the mixing bowl, and mix all the ingredients together with either a spoon or an electric dough mixer until the flour is completely absorbed, then continue kneading for 5 minutes. The dough will be ready when it’s smooth and slightly sticky – it will pull away from the sides of the bowl, but stick to the bottom of the bowl.",
    "7. Grease a medium bowl with the tablespoon of melted butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl and turn the dough over to coat it in the butter. Cover the bowl and leave the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 hours, or until it’s doubled in size.",
    "8. In a pan over a medium heat, add a tablespoon of the olive oil. Sweat the onion and bell pepper until softened, then add the sausage and sauté until cooked. Set aside.",
    "9. Fire up your pizza oven. Aim for a temperature of 260˚C at the center of the baking stone inside. You can check the temperature quickly and easily using an infrared thermometer.",
    "10. Divide the dough in half. Grease your Cast Iron Skillet with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the skillet. Leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes.",
    "11. Layer on the toppings, starting with the mozzarella, then the sausage, onion, and bell pepper mixture, and finally an even layer of the pizza sauce.",
    "12. Place the skillet in the back of the oven for 5 minutes, until the top is golden, and the crust is evenly browned, turning halfway through the bake. Move the skillet to the front of the oven and continue baking for another 20 minutes, rotating every few minutes. If the top of the crust looks like it’s browning too fast, turn off the oven, push the skillet to the middle of the oven to continue baking the pizza in the residual heat. The pizza is cooked when you can easily lift up the crust using tongs.",
    "13. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the pizza rest for 5 minutes. To serve, you can either slice it inside the skillet, or pull it out onto a serving board to slice – and enjoy all that saucy, cheesy goodness!"

    "1. In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flours and salt. Add the butter and mix on low speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture looks a little crumbly, about 1 minute. Add the water and mix until the dough comes together (4 minutes). Raise the speed to high and mix for 1 minute more, until the dough is smooth.",
    "2. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and form into a rough rectangular shape. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.",
    "3. In the same stand mixer bowl-this time fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and flour until combined. Scoop the mixture onto a piece of parchment paper and spread it into a rectangle about ½-inch thick and 6 x 9 inches. Cover and refrigerate–monitor until the Tempe rates reaches about 65°F to 70°F (It should be able to gently bend without breaking).",
    "4. When the dough and butter block are both chilled, but flexible, it’s time to lock the butter inside the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle slightly wider than the butter block, and twice the length (12 x 10 inches). Turn the rectangle so that one of the shorter ends is facing you.",
    "5. • Turn the butter onto the dough, positioning it so that there is a ½-inch margin of dough around the sides and bottom of the butter block. Gently stretch the top portion of the dough to fold it down over the butter block so that it meets the opposite edge of the dough. Press the edges of the dough together firmly all the way around to seal, then fold the excess dough at the bottom and edges under itself. You should now have a firm, but pliable rectangular package of dough (about 6 by 10 inches) enveloping the butter block. If the dough feels soft, refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20 minutes before proceeding. Otherwise, proceed with Fold A.",
    "6. Fold A: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to a rectangle about ½-inch thick. If you’re having a hard time rolling the dough, it might be to cold-let it stand at room temperature for 5 to 15 minutes. If the dough feels soft or squishy or melty butter is breaking through, it may be too warm, and may need more time in the refrigerator to firm up.",
    "7. • Position the dough so one of the shorter sides is facing you. The first fold is called a “four fold.” Fold the top portion of the dough about three-quarters of the way over the dough. Fold the bottom portion one quarter of the way over the dough so it meets the left edge (it should look like an open book with an off-center spine). Fold the larger side over the smaller side (essentially folding in half), then wrap and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "8. • Fold B: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a rectangle about ½-inch thick. The next fold is called a “three fold.” Face the dough so that one of the shorter sides of the rectangle is facing you. Fold the top portion of the dough about on third of the way over the dough. Do the same with the right edge, folding it one third of the way over, resting it on top of the other piece just folded (like the way you’d fold a standard piece of paper to fit into an envelope). Wrap and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "9. Fold C: Repeat steps 6 through 7 to perform another “four fold.”",
    "10. Fold D: Repeat step 8 to perform another “three fold.”",
    "11. After the final fold, the dough should be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for at least 12 hours before using (and up to 2 days). For longer storage, it can be frozen for up to 3 months (thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using).",
    "12. For paffles, we recommend rolling out the puff pastry to 1/8” in thickness and cutting the pastry to fit your waffle maker. It should bake for 4-6 minutes, depending on the temperature of your iron."
